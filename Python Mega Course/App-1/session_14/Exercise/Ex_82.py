# Water State Checker Advanced
# In the previous exercise, we hardcoded the values 0 and 100. However, it is better to place those values in constants. Therefore, your task is to:

# (1) create a FREEZING_POINT and a BOILING_POINT variable outside of the water_state function and store the values 0 and 100 in them respectively.

# (2) modify the function of the previous exercise by using the variables given above instead of the hardcoded 0 and 100 values.
# The previous function is provided in the coding area.

FREEZING_POINT = 0
BOILING_POINT = 100

def water_state(temperature):
    if temperature <= FREEZING_POINT:
        return "Solid"
    elif 0 < temperature < BOILING_POINT:
        return "Liquid"
    else:
        return "Gas"
