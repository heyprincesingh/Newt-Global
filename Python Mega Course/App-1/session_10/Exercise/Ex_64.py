# Loops and Slicing
# In the coding area we have defined a list of filenames. Your task is to:

# (1) loop over the list
# (2) print out the filename of each item without the extension using slicing.

# The output of your program would look like this:
# report
# downloads
# success
# folders

filenames = ["report.txt", "downloads.txt", "success.txt", "folders.txt"]

for filename in filenames:
    print(filename.split('.')[0])
