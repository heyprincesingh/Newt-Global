# Square Area Function
# Define a function that:

# (1) takes the side length of a square as a parameter
# (2) calculates and returns the area of a square.

# For example, if I was to call your function with foo(7)it would return 49.  You can name the function anyway you want.

def square_area(side_length):
    return side_length * side_length
