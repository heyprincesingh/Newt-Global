# Type Conversion and List Comprehension
# The coding area contains a list of numbers, each stored as a string. Your task is to add some code that:

# (1) converts the numbers from strings to floats, and
# (2) prints out the updated list.

# The output of your code should be as below. Notice the numbers are floats without quotes.
# [10.0, 19.1, 20.0]

user_entries = ['10', '19.1', '20']

user_entries = [float(entry) for entry in user_entries]
print(user_entries)
