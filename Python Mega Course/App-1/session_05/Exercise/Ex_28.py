# Enumeration 1
# In the coding area, we have a list of strings. Add some code that:

# (1) iterates over the list items,
# (2) prints out the index of each item, a colon ":", and the item.

# Here is how the output should look like:
# 0 : table
# 1 : chair
# 2 : door

products = ['table', 'chair', 'door']

for index, product in enumerate(products):
    print(index,":",product)
