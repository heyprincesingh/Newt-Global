# String Replace
# The string "pytgon" defined in the code has an incorrect letter. It should be "python". Your task is to add some code that

# (1) uses the replace() method to replace "g" with "h" in the string assigned to the language variable,
# (2) stores the result in the language variable by overwriting its existing value, and
# (3) prints out the updated variable.

language = "pytgon"

language = language.replace("g", "h")
print(language)
