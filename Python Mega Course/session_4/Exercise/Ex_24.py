# Tuple of Tuples
# Your task for this exercise is to:

# (1) create a color_codes variable and assign a tuple to it,
# (2) the tuple should contain three tuples as items.
# (3) each of the three tuples should contain three items. The items can be any type (e.g,, string, number, etc).


color_codes = (("red", "green", "blue"), ("yellow", "cyan", "magenta"), ("black", "white", "gray"))
print(color_codes)
