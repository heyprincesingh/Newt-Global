# Average Function
# Define a function that:

# (1) takes a list as an argument
# (2) returns the average value of the list items.
# For example, if I called your function with foo([10, 20, 30, 40]) it should return 25 which is the average of the numbers of the list.
# Note: You can name the function anyway you want. It's enough to define the function. There is no need to call it.

def average(list):
    return sum(list) / len(list)
