# List Comprehension
# We have defined a list of strings in the coding area. Your task is to add some code that:

# (1) uses list comprehension to capitalize all the names and surnames of the list, and
# (2) prints the updated list.

# The output of your code should be as below:
# ['John Smith', 'Jay Santi', 'Eva Kuki']

names = ["john smith", "jay santi", "eva kuki"]

names = [name.title() for name in names]
print(names)
