# With Context Manager and For-Loop
# In the coding area, we have defined a list of languages. Add some code that:

# (1) iterates over the list using a for-loop,
# (2) creates a new text file in each iteration using a with-context manager,
# (3) each file should be named according to the current item (i.e., English.txt, German.txt, and Spanish.txt).
# (4) the content of each file should be the item of the list (e.g., the content of the file English.txt should be English).

languages = ['English', 'German', 'Spanish']

for language in languages:
    with open(f'{language}.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(language)
