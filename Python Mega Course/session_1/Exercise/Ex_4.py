# Creating Lists of Variables
# We have defined a firstname variable in the code. Your task is to extend the code by:

# (1) adding a middlename and a lastname variable,

# (2) assign a string to each of the two variables,

# (3) create a list that contains the three variables,  and

# (4) assign that list to a variable named person.

firstname = "John"
middlename = "Kumar"
lastname = "Swami"

person = [firstname, middlename, lastname]
