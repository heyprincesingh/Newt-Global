# For-Loop and Title Case
# In the coding area, we have created an employees list. Below that line, write a for-loop block that:

# (1) iterates over the items of the employees list, and
# (2) prints out each item of the list in title case.


# In other words, here is what your program should print out:
# John Smith
# Sarah Bremen
# Dora Dawson

employees = ["john smith", "sarah bremen", "dora dawson"]

for employee in employees:
    print(employee.title())
