# Password Validation Function
# Complete the strength function. The function will check the strength of a given password. Specifically, the function should:

# (1) get a password argument
# (2) return the string "Strong Password" if all of the following conditions are true:
# Password is 8 or more characters
# Password has at least one uppercase letter
# Password has at least one digit.
# (3) if one or more of the above conditions are not met, the function should return "Weak Password".

# Note:  You can make use of the code we developed in the Bonus Example on Day 9.

def strength(password):
    if len(password) >= 8 and any(char.isupper() for char in password) and any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        return "Strong Password"
    else:
        return "Weak Password"
