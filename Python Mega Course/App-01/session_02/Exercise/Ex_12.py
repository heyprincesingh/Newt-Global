# Capitalize All Words
# Take a look at the existing code and:

# (1) add a line that capitalizes the first letter of  the string insentence and prints out the result,
# (2) add another line that capitalizes both words of the string in name and prints out the result.

# The expected output of your code would be:
# The sky is blue today.
# Sarah Smith

# sentence = "the sky is blue today."
# name = "sarah smith"

sentence = "the sky is blue today."
name = "sarah smith"

print(sentence.capitalize())
print(name.title())
