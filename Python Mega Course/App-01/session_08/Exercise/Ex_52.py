# With Context Manager with Reading and Writing
# In the coding area there is a story.txt file tab that contains some text. Your task is to make a copy of the story.txt file. Here are the exact steps:

# (1) Read the story.txt file using a with-context manager and store its text in a string variable.
# (2) Create a new story_copy.txt file using a second with-context and write the string variable in the file.


with open("story.txt", "r") as file:
    story = file.read()

with open("story_copy.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(story)
