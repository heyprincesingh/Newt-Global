# Advanced Temperature Function
# Define a function that:

# (1) takes temperature as a parameter
# (2) returns "Hot" if the temperature is greater than 25
# (3) returns "Warm" if the temperature is between 15 and 25, including 15 and 25.
# (4) returns "Cold" if the temperature is less than 15.

# If I called your function with foo(10) it would return "Cold". 
# Calling it with foo(15), foo(16), or foo(25) would all return "Warm". Calling it with foo(26) would return "Hot".


def temperature(temperature):
    if temperature > 25:
        return "Hot"
    elif 15 <= temperature <= 25:
        return "Warm"
    else:
        return "Cold"
