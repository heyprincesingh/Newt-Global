# For-Loop
# In the coding area, we have created a members list. Below that line, write a for-loop block that:

# (1) iterates over the items of the members list, and
# (2) prints out each item of the list with the first letter capitalized.

# In other words, here is what your program should print out:

# John
# Sarah
# Dora

members = ["john", "sarah", "dora"]

for member in members:
    print(member.capitalize())
