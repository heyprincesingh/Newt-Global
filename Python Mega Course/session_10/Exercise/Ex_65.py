# Loops, Slicing, and String Manipulation
# This exercise is similar to the previous one but with an added feature. In the coding area we have defined a list of filenames. Your task is to:

# (1) loop over the list

# (2) print out the filename of each item without the extension using slicing and with the first letter capitalized.

# The output of your program would look like this:

# Report
# Downloads
# Success
# Folders

filenames = ["report.txt", "downloads.txt", "success.txt", "folders.txt"]

for filename in filenames:
    print(filename.split('.')[0].capitalize())
