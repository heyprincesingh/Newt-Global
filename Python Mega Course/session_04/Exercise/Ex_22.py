# String Replace and For-Loop
# The code area contains a list of usernames. Add some that code:

# (1) iterates over the list of usernames,
# (2) replaces the white space " " of each username with an underscore "_",
# (3) prints out the updated username in each iteration.


usernames = ['the blueman', 'sorted hedgehog', 'infinite lagoon']

for username in usernames:
    username = username.replace(" ", "_")
    print(username)
