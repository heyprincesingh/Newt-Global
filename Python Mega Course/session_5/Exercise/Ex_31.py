# Enumeration, f-strings, and Capitalizing
# Similar to the previous exercise, we have a list of three strings defined in the code area. Your task is to:

# (1) iterate over the filenames list,
# (2) capitalize the first letter of each string,
# (3) add a number and a dash in front of each string, and .txt at the end, and
# (4) print each modified string as shown below.

# 0-Document.txt
# 1-Report.txt
# 2-Presentation.txt

# Notice the first letter of each string is capitalized.

filenames = ['document', 'report', 'presentation']

for index, filename in enumerate(filenames):
    print(f"{index}-{filename.capitalize()}.txt")
