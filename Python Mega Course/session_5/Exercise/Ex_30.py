# Enumeration and f-strings
# In the code area we have a list of strings. Your task is to write some code that:

# (1) iterates over the filenames list,
# (2) adds a number and a dash in front of each string, and .txt at the end using f-strings, and
# (3) prints each modified string as shown below.

# 0-document.txt
# 1-report.txt
# 2-presentation.txt

filenames = ['document', 'report', 'presentation']

for index, filename in enumerate(filenames):
    print(f"{index}-{filename}.txt")
