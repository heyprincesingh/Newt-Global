# For-Loop and Sorted List
# We have defined a list of floats in the coding area. Add some code that:

# (1) sorts the list in ascending order,
# (2) iterates over the sorted list
# (3) prints out each item in each iteration

# Here is what the output should look like:

# 166.9
# 175.8
# 177.8
# 182.5

measurements = [177.8, 175.8, 166.9, 182.5]

measurements.sort()

for measurement in measurements:
    print(measurement)
