# Length Calculation in For-Loop
# We have defined a list in the coding area. Add some code that:

# (1) iterates over the items of mylist,
# (2) prints out the current length of the list in each iteration

# Here is how the output would look like:

# 4
# 4
# 4
# 4

mylist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

for item in mylist:
    print(len(mylist))
